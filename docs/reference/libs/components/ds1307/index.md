* `addr`: Slave address. Default 0x68;

* `drvname`: I2C Bus used. Default I2C0;

* `clk`: Clock speed. Default 400kHz.

### method get_time
```python
get_time()
```
Returns a tuple with the RTC time.

The tuple format is the following: `(hours, minutes, seconds, day, month, year, day_of_week)`.

### method set_time
```python

```python
from bsp import board
from components.ds1307 import ds1307

...

rtc = ds1307.DS1307()

rtc.set_time(14, 30, 0, 10, 7, 21, 5)
while True:
    print(rtc.get_time())
    sleep(1000)
```
