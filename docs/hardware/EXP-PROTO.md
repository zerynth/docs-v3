# Prototyping Expansion Board

The EXP-PROTO expansion board is a prototyping board, enables connecting and interfacing external sensors, actuators or devices.
The EXP-PROTO gives flexibility to the user to prototype any sensor, display, MCU or IC in their project. The developer is free to connect any device to the board and interface it using the Z-Bus.
Zerynth provides hardware development services and Certification services for the users who are interested in releasing their product in the market.

Zerynth expansion boards work seamlessly with all of Zerynth Development boards, combined they can act as a Development Board for prototyping a Product, and a core for industrial applications.

The Z-bus allows the connection in a cascade of different add-on modules to create specific industrial applications that fit into a DIN-RAIL case.
