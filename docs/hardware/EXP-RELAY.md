# **EXP-RELAY**

The EXP-RELAY expansion board is an output module that features 6 General Purpose Relays rated at 6A 250VAC. The board enables the developers to control motors, fuel pump, industrial applications where control of high voltages and currents is intended, controlling large power loads.

Zerynth expansion boards work seamlessly with all of Zerynth Development boards, combined they can act as a Development Board for prototyping a Product, and a core for industrial applications.

## **Power**

Power to the EXP-RELAY is supplied directly by the ZM1-DB.

 	
## **Z-Bus**

The modular expansion system uses the Z-Bus. The Z-Bus is an efficient, powerful standard for connecting and prototyping different sensors and devices.
The Z-Bus is using the CN1 pin header (20x2) exposing the following:

* 16 GPIO pins.
* 4 interrupt pins.
* 2 USART/UART instances with full support (TX,RX,RTS,CTS)
* I2C, SPI support.
* 5V, 3.3 V output pins.
* Enable pin for controlling the power to attached expansion boards.

!!! note 
    The development boards support up to 3 attached expansion boards.
